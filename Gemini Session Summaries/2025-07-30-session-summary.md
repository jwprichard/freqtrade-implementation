# 2025-07-30: Hyperoptimization, Backtesting, and Deployment of Momentum Crossover V3 Strategy

## Summary

This session focused on finalizing, hyperoptimizing, backtesting, and deploying the `momentum_crossover_v3_strategy`. The primary goal was to find the optimal parameters for the strategy, evaluate its performance, and launch it in a clean dry-run environment.

## Key Activities

1.  **Initial Setup & Configuration:**
    *   Created the initial `config.json` file to enable backtesting and hyperoptimization.
    *   Iteratively debugged and corrected several configuration issues, including:
        *   Setting an appropriate `dry_run_wallet` balance.
        *   Adding the required `entry_pricing` and `exit_pricing` sections.
        *   Configuring the `pairlists` to use the static whitelist.

2.  **Strategy & Hyperopt Adjustments:**
    *   Corrected the class names in both the strategy file (`momentum_crossover_v3_strategy.py`) and the hyperopt loss file (`profit_drawdown_loss.py`) to match Freqtrade's naming conventions.
    *   Added a `sell_rsi_level` parameter to the strategy to enable optimization of the sell space.
    *   Modified the `profit_drawdown_loss` function to be self-contained by calculating the drawdown internally, resolving a `KeyError: 'max_drawdown'`.

3.  **Hyperparameter Optimization:**
    *   Successfully ran a 100-epoch hyperoptimization using the `profit_drawdown_loss` function.
    *   The best-performing parameters were found at epoch 64, yielding a 14.94% profit over 21 trades.
    *   The optimal parameters were saved to `user_data/strategies/momentum_crossover_v3_strategy.json`.

4.  **Backtesting:**
    *   Conducted a backtest using the newly optimized parameters over the same timerange.
    *   The backtest results were highly positive, showing a **16.61% total profit** with a **91.3% win rate** and a low **2.00% max drawdown**.

5.  **Dry-Run Deployment & Debugging:**
    *   Troubleshot issues related to starting the bot with the web UI.
    *   Corrected the `docker-compose.yml` to use the `momentum_crossover_v3_strategy`.
    *   Enabled the API server through the `config.json` file for web UI access.
    *   Reset the bot's trade history by deleting the `tradesv3.sqlite` database to ensure a clean start.

## Outcome

The `momentum_crossover_v3_strategy` was successfully optimized, backtested, and deployed in a clean dry-run environment with the web UI enabled.
